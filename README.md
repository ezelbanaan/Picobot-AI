# Picobot-AI
AI can be run using `genetic_algorithm(pop_size, num_gens)` where `pop_size` is the population size and `num_gens` is the number of generations. The artificial intelligence works by first generating a random population, it then calculates the fitness per program this is saved in the variable `evaluated_fitnesses` together with the corresponding program. To calculate the survivors we first sorted the `evaluated_fitnesses` and then reversed it so the best programs will be at the beginning. Then using slicing we created the list `survivors`, these were used as "parents" for the next generation. The surviving programs then were supplemented with "children", new programs. Each time 2 random "parents" are picked from the `survivor` list, who then are used to generate "children" using `crossover()`. Then there is still a chance that the programs will mutate, this depends on the `MUTATION_RATE`. At the end the best program will be printed together with its fitness value.
